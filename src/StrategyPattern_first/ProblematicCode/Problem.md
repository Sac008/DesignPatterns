# There is a Flaw in this Design

## What if let's say there are 50 Types of Ducks so we will create 50 different Duck classes now let's say 20 of them use one type of flying behavior and 20 of them use one different type of behavior and rest of them use one type of flying behavior same for quacking also. Now let's say a requirement came that this flyBehavior should be modified then all the classes that implements that behavior should be modified right which can be a nightmare. So why don't we create concrete flying behaviors if 20 of them use same bhavior then one concrete FlyingBehavior class will hold one fly method which willl be used by all the 20 duck classes so now there is only one implementation place and if any changes come for that flying behavior then only one place will be modified. You can now check the Better code this implementation is done there.
